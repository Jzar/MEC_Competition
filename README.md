# SpeechAssistant 

### MEC Programming Competition Group 86

SpeechAssistant is a cross-platform application that enables people with inhibited movement and inability to articulate themselves through a text-to-speech interface.

SpeechAssistant has a variety of feautres that enables the user to easily articulate their thoughts. One of these features is "Saved Phrases", which allows the user to quickly respond to others. The application has built-in responses such as "Yes", "No", "Hello" and "How are you?". The user may also add custom phrases to the application, allowing their experienced to be customized to how they most often interact with others.  

### Future Features
Given the time, there were many features that we were unable to implement, but would be ideal to add to the application.

  1.  The ability to send an SMS to selected contacts in the event of an emergency.
       *  This could be done in multiple levels; a certain message sent in cases of a low-emergency situations, another if the situation is more dire, etc.
  2.  A button that can be pressed that sends a call to 911 with a pre-programmed message including the users' current location, and some details about the user, such as their age, condition, and a general physical description. The user would have the ability to customize this message.
  3.  The ability to combine multiple saved phrases to create a full sentence. 
  4.  A "listen first" button that allows the user to hear the phrase before it is said out loud. This would be done through the use of headphones.
  5.  Settings that allow the user to customize the voice so that it can be either a male or female sounding voice.
  

This application uses [ReactNative](http://www.reactnative.com/) and [Expo](https://expo.io/). The text-to-speech functionality is also from [Expo](https://expo.io/).
